(ns lgx.cron
  "In-process cron spec loader — clj port of `lg_x/cron.py` (ADR-2606280030).

  The Python module used APScheduler to register CronTrigger jobs from the `crons`
  array in `langgraph.json`. langgraph.json currently declares `crons: []`, so this
  is a no-op in practice; the loader is ported faithfully so a future schedule keeps
  the same shape. Actual scheduling under bb is a launchd LaunchAgent invoking a bb
  task (root CLAUDE.md §Residence), NOT an in-process scheduler — so this port
  provides spec LOADING + a fire closure, and leaves residency to launchd
  (deviation from the APScheduler in-process model, per the operational-code rule)."

(ns lgx.graphs.compose-tweet
  "x.etzhayyim.com `compose_tweet` graph — draft tweet/thread copy (no posting).
  clj port of `lg_x/graphs/compose_tweet.py` onto langgraph-clj (ADR-2606280030).

  Pure LLM compose path. Does NOT call X API (that is a future `post` graph that
  needs OAuth). Safest first ship: drafts are human-reviewable before any API call.

  Output shape:
    :format     single | thread | quote_tweet | reply
    :tweets     vector of strings, each ≤280 chars (X's hard limit)
    :rationale  1-line \"why this hook\"
    :hashtags   vector of strings, up to 4

  Topology: compose → emit_audit (same as Python). LLM via Murakumo loopback."

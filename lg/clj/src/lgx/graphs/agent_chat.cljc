  "x.etzhayyim.com `agent_chat` graph — community / strategist / analyst persona
  chat. clj port of `lg_x/graphs/agent_chat.py` onto langgraph-clj (ADR-2606280030).

  Roles aligned with platform-X creator-economy ops:
    community_manager — replies, mentions triage
    strategist        — content calendar, hook design, A/B framing
    analyst           — engagement / impressions / CTR readings
    ghostwriter       — draft tweet copy in user's voice
    trend_scout       — surface trending topics & niche memes

  Topology: resolve_actor → llm_call → emit_audit (same as Python). LLM call goes
  to the Murakumo loopback (lgx.llm), not the RunPod proxy."

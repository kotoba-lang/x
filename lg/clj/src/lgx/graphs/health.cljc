(ns lgx.graphs.health
  "x `health` graph — simplest possible end-to-end probe. clj port of
  `lg_x/graphs/health.py` onto langgraph-clj (ADR-2606280030).

  Replaces BPMN `x_health` (NSID: com.etzhayyim.apps.x.health). Confirms the
  server can: (1) compile a graph, (2) report a substrate-health reading,
  (3) emit audit (fire-and-forget). Primary smoke endpoint for the runbook.

  Port deviation: the Python node opened a RisingWave/Postgres connection
  (`SELECT 1`). RisingWave is the charter-PROHIBITED substrate (root CLAUDE.md
  §State), so this port does NOT reintroduce a PG driver. With no `RW_URL` set
  (the charter-aligned default) the probe returns `:rw-ok false` exactly as the
  Python node did when `RW_URL` was unset; a future kotoba-engine health probe
  is the proper replacement. Same graph topology, same audit, same output keys."
